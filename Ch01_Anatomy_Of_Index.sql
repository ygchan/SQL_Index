-- Chapter 01 Anatomy Of An Index

-- "An Index makes the query fast". But often people and book just knows about
-- that and doesn't understand details.

-- An Index is a new structure in the database that is built using the 
-- create index statement. It requires its own hard disk space and hold an 
-- indexed version of the data. 

-- Searching an index is like searching in a phone book, or back of the 
-- book for list of dictionary. It is fast because they are organzied, instead
-- of giving a big messy data, that you have to look through it one by one.
